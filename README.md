# Predictive Model Development for AlphabetSoup's Funding Program

### Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a binary classifier for Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit foundation, to predict the success of applicants' ventures if funded. By leveraging machine learning and neural network techniques, the objective is to create a robust tool based on a provided dataset containing various organizations' information.

### Technologies and Methods Used
The project incorporates the following technologies and techniques:
- Machine Learning
- Neural Networks
- Keras Tuner
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Permutaion importance 

### Project Description
The main objective of this project is to build a binary classifier that can accurately predict the success of ventures if they receive funding from Alphabet Soup. This prediction model is developed by employing machine learning and neural network techniques.

To start, a comprehensive dataset consisting of over 34,000 organizations funded by Alphabet Soup is utilized. The dataset contains crucial information, including application type, affiliation, classification, use case, organization type, funding request amount, and more. This dataset is processed and refined to improve its quality and relevance to the classification task.

The next step involves creating a neural network model using the Keras Tuner. The model architecture is optimized by tuning hyperparameters such as the number of hidden layers, nodes in each layer, and the choice of activation functions. The hyperband tuner is utilized to perform this optimization, aiming to maximize the validation accuracy of the model.

Once the model is trained and optimized, its performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics. The evaluation results demonstrate the model's ability to accurately predict the success of funded ventures, surpassing the defined target.

Moreover, permutation importance analysis is conducted to identify the most influential features in the model's predictions. This analysis provides insights into the significance of different features and helps understand their impact on the model's decision-making process.

Please note that a comprehensive report detailing the project methodology, findings, and conclusions is included in the attached repository.

### Conclusion
The developed predictive model, driven by machine learning and a Keras neural network, serves as a powerful tool for Alphabet Soup. It enables the foundation to make informed decisions by accurately identifying applicants with a higher probability of venture success. The model's deployment empowers Alphabet Soup to maximize the impact of their funding allocation.
